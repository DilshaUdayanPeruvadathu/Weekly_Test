Question 2 : In how many ways can we loop in an array describe each with an example ?

Answer :
    1. an array is to use a for loop:
    =====================================
    A for loop can be used to access every element of an array. The array begins at zero, and the array property length is used to set the loop end.

    Eg: 
        var mammals = new Array("cat","dog","human","whale","seal");
        var animalString = "";
        for (var i = 0; i < mammals. length; i++) {
        animalString += mammals[i] + " ";
        }
        alert(animalString);

    2. use a while loop and test the array elements:
    ===================================================
    the index counter, i, is incremented as itâ€™s used to access an array element. The use of i++ means that the existing value of i is accessed first, and then the variable is incremented.

    Eg: 
        var numArray = new Array(1,4,66,123,240,444,555);
        var i = 0;

        while (numArray[i] < 100) {
            alert(numArray[i++]);
        }

    3. Foreach
    ============
    The function will be executed for every single element of the array. It must take at least one parameter which represents the elements of an array:

    Eg: 
        var numArray = new Array(1,4,66,123,240,444,555);
        numArray.forEach(function(number) {
            console.log(number);
        });
